建立数据库
create database Student;
建立表
use Student;
create table Student;
插入一列
alter table Student add column score varchar(40) not null;
删除一行
alter table Student drop column score;
修改单值
update Student set score = 50 where Snumber not like '';
更名查询
select S# as DB where ...(显示出的表的对应S#的表头会变成DB)
模糊查询
select S# where Sname like '%'(任意字符)
select S# where Sname like '_'(单个字符)
select S# where Sname like '\%'(出现%)
结果排序
select S# where Sname like 'x%' order by S# asc;(按S#的从小到大排序)
select S# where Sname like 'x%' order by S# desc;(按S#的从大到小排序)
重复元组
select distinct Sage from Student where score > 50;(出来的结果是不重复的Sage)
插入数据
insert into Teacher values( '1143710514', 'zhangahojin', '21', 'da', '62');
改变列顺序
 alter table Teacher modify score varchar(03) after grade;
多表联合检索
select Teacher.Sname as ageT, Student.Sname as ageS from Teacher, Student where Teacher.Sname like '%jin' and Student.Sname like '%jin';
插入主键
alter table Teacher add constraint PK_Teacher primary key(Snumber);
all谓词
 select Teacher.Snumber as 'T#', Teacher.score as 'Ts' from Teacher where Teacher.score <= all(select score from Teacher);
in谓词
select Teacher.Snumber as 'T#', Teacher.score as 'Ts', Student.Snumber as 'S#',Student.score as 'Ss' from Student, Teacher where Student.score in (select Student.score from Student where Student.score > Teacher.score) order by Teacher.Snumber asc;
改变属性
alter table Student modify score varchar(20) not null;
